{"name":"Notr","tagline":"Social Metadata for URLs","body":"Notr\r\n====\r\n\r\nNotr provides a text-based interface for managing URL-based metadata such as\r\ntags, associated links, and public notes. All content submitted using notr.info\r\nis accessible to other Notr users.\r\n\r\nNotr is currently only available for Google Chrome (desktop). It has been\r\ntested and should work on Windows, OS X, and Linux.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Notr\r\n==========\r\n\r\nOnce the Chrome extension is installed, it can be activated by pressing the Ctrl\r\nor Cmd key twice (tap-tap). A popup window should appear similar to the one below.\r\n\r\n![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scovetta/notr/master/images/screenshot-1.png?raw=true \"Screenshot\")\r\n\r\nWhenever a command is typed and you press 'enter', a command is sent to the Notr\r\nserver (https://notr.info), and a response is returned back to you. No caching\r\nis currently in place.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity & Privacy\r\n==================\r\n\r\nWhen Notr is installed, one of the first things the extension does is to generate\r\na long random identifier. This will be used when interacting with the web-service\r\nfor a few reasons:\r\n\r\n*   To prevent and recover from abuse (malicious, spam, harassing, etc.)\r\n*   To enable per-user features such as a personal \"read later\" list.\r\n\r\nA future version will likely enable more robust authentication (such as using\r\nOAuth) for an enhanced user experience.\r\n\r\nThe Notr back-end service stores the following information:\r\n\r\n*   Standard web server logs (URLs, source IP addresses, etc.)\r\n*   The unique identifier described above\r\n*   The actual URL and textual content submitted\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n================\r\n\r\nI'd like to acknowledge the following resources leveraged by this extension.\r\n\r\n*   images/flag.png: http://veryicon.com/icons/system/farm-fresh/flag-red-1.html\r\n*   images/notr-logo-*.png: http://veryicon.com/icons/system/blawb/notes-14.html\r\n*   jQuery\r\n*   Lots of examples from Stack Overflow\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me via my Github contact page.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
